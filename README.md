This is my first full stack project.
It is a dummy e-commerce site where a user can browse and buy products.
I have used html, css and js for the frontend. I always go for simplicity :)
I have used express for the backend and MySQL for the database.
The database is hosted locally hence the repo would not work if u clone it.
It works seamlessly and I am proud of it.
